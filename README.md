# fract-ol
Fractâ€™ol is a computer graphics project aimed at generating visually appealing fractals. In this project, I will use the 1337 school graphical library, MiniLibX, to create a basic computer graphics project. I will get to explore the mathematical concept of complex numbers, learn about optimization in computer graphics, and practice event handling.

This project provides an excellent opportunity to learn about computer graphics, explore the mathematical concept of fractals, and develop your programming skills.
